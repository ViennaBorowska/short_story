This file will contain a short silly funny rhyme.

There was a Manchester cohort,
whos launchpad was not so short
they all worked hard
but wished they had a bard
who rocked a big old mohawk

In the realm of code, I reside,
Where syntax and logic collide.
With curly braces neat,
And bugs we defeat,
In algorithms, our skills abide.
